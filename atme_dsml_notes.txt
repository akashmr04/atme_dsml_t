vs_code, git, notepad_pp, node, python 

Cut and paste all the installer files into their respective folders.
Now double click all these setup files and install them.
Note: While installing have a look at where these Apps/software are installed.

When we have installed an App but its command is not available globally, then to make it available globally, we have to add its path to Environment variables.

For example, mysql or mongodb or mingw etc path are not added to EV.
So to add them to EV, we have to copy the path where they are installed.
For example mysql is installed in the path:
C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin
Copy this path
search ENV in windows search
Click Edit environment variables
Click Environment Variable button
Double Click Path
Click New
Paste the path
